## Introduction
Danny‚Äôs got a passion for pizza üçï‚Äîand a knack for thinking big. After seeing the potential in 80s retro styling and the growing trend of food delivery services, he came up with the idea of Pizza Runner. Combining fresh pizza with on-demand delivery, he built a mobile app, recruited runners, and got his pizza empire off the ground. Now, he needs some help optimizing his operations with data to take his business to the next level.
### Business Challenge
Danny‚Äôs goal is to fine-tune his operations by better understanding customer and runner behavior, improving delivery efficiency, and analyzing ingredients and pricing strategies. With data already collected, the next step is cleaning it up and applying some solid analysis to boost performance and grow the businessüìà.

## Skills showcased
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
  - Cleaned and formatted data from multiple tables (e.g., exclusions, extras).
  - Ensured data integrity for reporting on pizza orders, customer activities, and runner performance.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**
  - Created joins and subqueries to answer complex business questions.
  - Used window functions (like RANK(), DENSE_RANK()) to analyze and rank customer purchases and runner performance.
- **Data Analysis & Problem Solving**
  - Analyzed customer ordering behavior, purchase frequency, and delivery times.
  - Optimized ingredient usage, pricing strategies, and delivery logistics.
- **Visualization & Reporting**
  - Presented key insights in an easily digestible format to support decision-making for operational improvements.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 5 tables:
- <code>runners</code>: Details about the delivery runners (ID, registration date).
- <code>customer_orders</code>: Orders placed by customers, including pizza type, exclusions, and extras.
- <code>runner_orders</code>: Assignment of orders to runners, with pickup times, distances, and cancellations.
- <code>pizza_names</code>: Names of available pizza types.
- <code>pizza_recipes</code>: Ingredients for each pizza.

## Data Wrangling
Before jumping into the analysis, I took some time to clean and normalize the data to make sure everything was consistent and ready for use. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what I did with the <code>customer_orders</code> and <code>runner_orders</code> tables:

### Cleaning the <code>customer_orders</code> table
- **Handled NaN Values:** Fixed any NaN values in the exclusions and extras columns, turning them into NULL for consistency.
- **Replaced NULL with Empty Strings:** Cleaned up the exclusions and extras columns by replacing NULL values with empty strings ('').
- **Trimmed Spaces:** Got rid of any extra commas or spaces in exclusions and extras to tidy things up.

2. Cleaning the runner_orders Table
Fixed Cancellations: Turned any NaN values in the cancellation column into NULL for consistency.
Replaced NULL with Empty Strings: Did the same for the pickup_time, distance, and duration columns.
-- Replacing 'NaN', 'null' and NULL values in cancellation column with an empty string
UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
SET cancellation = ''
WHERE cancellation = 'NaN' 
	OR cancellation = 'null' 
  OR cancellation IS NULL;
